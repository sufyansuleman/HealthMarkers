Description: Provides functions to compute a broad suite of clinical and
    research biomarkers from routine data. Implemented measures include
    metabolic indices of insulin sensitivity and resistance (fasting, oral
    glucose tolerance test, adipose, tracer or DXA based), lipid markers,
    liver steatosis and fibrosis scores, anthropometric z-scores, obesity
    indices, cardiovascular risk scores and blood pressure indices,
    pulmonary function measures (e.g., lung age and percent predicted FEV1),
    biomarker panels from alternate biofluids (urine, saliva, sweat), and
    bone markers derived from DXA scans. All calculations can be accessed
    through a unified 'health_markers()' dispatcher function.

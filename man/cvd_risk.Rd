\title{Compute cardiovascular risk or marker by selected model}
\usage{
cvd_risk(
  data,
  model = c("ALL", "ASCVD", "QRISK3", "MESA", "Stroke", "RiskScorescvd", "AIP", "LDL_PN"),
  year = 10,
  ...,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame required by your chosen model.}

\item{model}{One of:
\itemize{
\item "ALL"
\item Risk calculators: "ASCVD","QRISK3","MESA","Stroke","RiskScorescvd"
\item Lipid markers: "AIP","LDL_PN"
}}

\item{year}{Risk horizon (10 or 30) for applicable models; ignored for lipid markers.}

\item{...}{Forwarded to underlying wrappers (e.g., col_map, na_action).}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if TRUE, prints progress (legacy; messages now routed via hm_inform).}
}
\value{
A tibble.
}
\description{
Dispatch to the appropriate risk or marker function, or run all of them.
Includes basic argument validation and robust fallback to NA rows if
individual calculators fail.

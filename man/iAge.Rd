\title{Compute a simplified Inflammatory Age Index (iAge)}
\usage{
iAge(
  data,
  col_map,
  weights = c(CRP = 0.33, IL6 = 0.33, TNFa = 0.34),
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{data.frame} or \code{tibble} containing at least the columns mapped by \code{col_map}.}

\item{col_map}{Named \code{list} mapping:
\itemize{
\item \code{CRP}  -> column name for C-reactive protein (mg/L).
\item \code{IL6}  -> column name for interleukin-6 (pg/mL).
\item \code{TNFa} -> column name for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (pg/mL).
}}

\item{weights}{Named \code{numeric} vector of weights for each marker (must sum to 1).
Defaults to \code{c(CRP = 0.33, IL6 = 0.33, TNFa = 0.34)}.}

\item{verbose}{\code{logical}; if \code{TRUE}, prints progress messages.}
}
\value{
A \code{tibble} with one column:
\itemize{
\item \code{iAge} (numeric): the computed inflammatory age index.
}
}
\description{
Implements a linear proxy for immunosenescence based on key inflammatory biomarkers,
following the approach described by Sayed \emph{et al.} (2021, \emph{Nature Aging}).
}
\details{
This function calculates iAge as a weighted sum of C-reactive protein (CRP),
interleukin-6 (IL6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa) using user-specified
or default weights. Higher iAge values are associated with accelerated immune aging
and increased risk of age-related disease, as validated against clinical outcomes.

\examples{
library(tibble)
df <- tibble(
  CRP  = c(1.2, 3.5, 0.8), # mg/L
  IL6  = c(2.0, 4.1, 1.5), # pg/mL
  TNFa = c(1.0, 1.8, 0.9) # pg/mL
)
iAge(
  df,
  col_map = list(CRP = "CRP", IL6 = "IL6", TNFa = "TNFa"),
  weights = c(CRP = 0.3, IL6 = 0.4, TNFa = 0.3)
)

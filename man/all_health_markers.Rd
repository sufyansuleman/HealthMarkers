\usage{
all_health_markers(
  data,
  col_map,
  which = "all",
  include_insulin = TRUE,
  normalize = c("none", "z", "inverse", "range", "robust"),
  mode = c("both", "IS", "IR"),
  verbose = TRUE,
  na_action = c("keep", "omit", "error")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame or tibble.}

\item{col_map}{Named list for column mapping forwarded to underlying functions.}

\item{which}{"all" or a vector of registry keys (see Details).}

\item{include_insulin}{Logical; include all_insulin_indices() first.}

\item{normalize}{One of c("none","z","inverse","range","robust").}

\item{mode}{One of c("both","IS","IR") passed to insulin indices.}

\item{verbose}{Logical.}

\item{na_action}{One of c("keep","omit","error"); forwarded to underlying calculators (HM-CS v2).}
}
\value{
Data frame with original columns plus many derived markers.
}
\description{
Compute all available HealthMarkers categories
}
\note{
For academic / clinical references tied to each derived marker or
index, consult the help pages of the source functions (e.g. ?allostatic_load,
?bone_markers, ?vitamin_markers, ?inflammatory_markers, etc.). This
aggregator provides integration only and does not restate citations.
